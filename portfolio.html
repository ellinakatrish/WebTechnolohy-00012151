<div class="portofolio-sec1 section1">“All of our actions in the past and at present describe us.”</div>
<div class="portofolio-sec2 section1">Hello, my name is Ellina, I’m eighteen and I don’t know who I am. I was born in Samarkand, Uzbekistan and after some time my family moved to Tashkent and both of the cities are very significant to me. Mostly, I have spent my childhood in Samarkand where I was in love with music.</div>
<div class="portofolio-sec3 section1"> As a result, I graduated from musical school, where I have learned to play the guitar, ukulele, piano, singing and everything was for a half. I haven't read a lot of books and read the detective stories and modern but at the same time I had realized to write stories and with time my sleeps were like very emotional and elaborated scenarios of a film.</div>
<div class="portofolio-sec4"></div>
<div class="portofolio-sec5 section1">My dream that with time has become the purpose is to achieve the carrier of a film director. Photography is not just a hobby for me, it’s part of my life. I often went through old photographs taken by our family and peered the details.  Mostly I liked that almost every picture has special meaning story. not every from there is happy and fun but every is unique. When I was fourteen my relatives paid the course of “base of photography” and I had a lot of practice with different styles of photography with my relatives and friends.</div>
<div class="portofolio-sec6"></div>
<div class="portofolio-sec7 section1">The world of photography has opened to me and I felt that “the camera chose me”, neither I it. In Russian this phrase means the occasion where you find something that was yours whole your life. Photography means for me the ability to share with my view of the world with others.</div>
